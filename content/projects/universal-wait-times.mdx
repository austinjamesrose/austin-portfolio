## Why This Exists

I'm the kind of person who checks theme park wait times even when I have no plans to visit. There's something fascinating about watching patterns emerge - the morning rush, the afternoon lull, the chaos of holiday weekends.

I wanted a better way to visualize this data than what was available, so I built one.

## How It Works

A GitHub Actions workflow runs every 30 minutes, pulling live wait time data and storing it in a SQLite database. The Streamlit dashboard lets you slice the data by ride, hour, day of week, or date range.

## What's Interesting

The data confirms some intuitions (mornings are better, weekdays beat weekends) but also surfaces surprises. Some rides have completely different wait patterns than you'd expect. Holiday seasons are particularly fun to watch unfold in real-time.

Could this help plan an actual trip? Sure. But mostly it scratches a curiosity itch and gave me an excuse to build a data pipeline I'd actually use.
