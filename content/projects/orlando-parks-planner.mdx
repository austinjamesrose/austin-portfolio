## The Problem

Five days at Disney and Universal with my wife, kids, and mom. Five Lightning Lane reservations per day, dining reservations across multiple parks, park hopping between locations. Keeping track of where we needed to be and when was a logistical puzzle - and I wanted to actually enjoy the trip, not stare at a spreadsheet.

## What I Built

The app started as an itinerary visualizer: see all our commitments laid out by time and location. Then it grew.

I added live wait time data so we could check lines without jumping between apps. User profiles let my wife and mom add their preferences. Shows and food options got layered in. By the end, it was a single place to manage everything.

## The AI Layer

The real utility came from Claude as an on-the-go assistant. Standing in Jurassic Park with 90 minutes until park close? Ask it what to do given our location, current wait times, and what we've already done.

I fed it a 100-page PDF from Disney Food Blog so it knew about all the holiday seasonal food available. It could suggest what to eat, what to skip, and how to fit it all in.

## The Tech

React frontend hosted on GitHub Pages. Claude API for the assistant layer. Wait time data from [Queue-Times.com](https://queue-times.com/).

## Did It Work?

We used it every day of the trip. Not a polished product - just a tool that made a complicated vacation easier to navigate.
