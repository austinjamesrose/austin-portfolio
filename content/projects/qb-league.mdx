## The Problem

My friends and I run a fantasy football league where we only draft quarterbacks. We were tracking stats by hand every few weeks, which meant standings were always outdated and nobody knew where they stood until someone finally updated the spreadsheet.

## The Solution

I built qbleague.xyz in a night using Claude Code. It automatically pulls QB stats and calculates scores based on our custom rules, so standings update as games finish instead of whenever someone remembers to do the math.

## How It Works

The site pulls official NFL data via nflreadpy, tracking passing yards, rushing yards, touchdowns, interceptions, and QB wins. Our scoring system has some quirks (prime time wins count extra), and the site handles all of it automatically.

## What's Next

This is fresh - we haven't run a full season with it yet. But the days of hand-tracking stats in a spreadsheet are over.
